# SQL-Library-Management-System
Basic SQL simulation for a library book management system.
The .CSV files are small pieces of data I loaded using stored procedures on MySQL Workbench, and the LMS_sim.sql file is a MySQL script I wrote to create and query the data.
The script itself is self-explainatory I believe and the comments will surely help with guiding you through the code.
